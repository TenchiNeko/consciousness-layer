Clean Code: Comments

The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code. Comments are always failures. We must have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them, but their use is not a cause for celebration.

Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all. They delude and mislead. They set expectations that will never be fulfilled. Truth can only be found in one place: the code. Only the code can truly tell you what it does. It is the only source of truly accurate information. Therefore, though comments are sometimes necessary, we will expend significant energy to minimize them.

Do not use a comment when you can use a function or a variable. Consider the following stretch of code: if the code is clear enough, the comment is simply unnecessary noise. Rather than decorating your code with comments to explain what it does, spend that energy making the code itself clearer.

A comment may be used to amplify the importance of something that may otherwise seem inconsequential. A comment may be used as a warning of consequences. But these are the exceptions, not the rule.
